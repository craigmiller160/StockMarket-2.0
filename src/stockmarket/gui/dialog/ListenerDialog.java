/**
 * Interface extending the <tt>ListenerView</tt> interface and
 * adding methods specifically intended for dialog implementations.
 * The main purpose of this interface is to allow dialogs to best
 * utilize the <ttListenerView</tt> API, and so the documentations
 * for that super-interface should be consulted before implementing
 * this interface.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the <tt>ListenerView</tt> methods, this interface
 * provides four dialog-specific methods that will need to be 
 * implemented. <tt>showDialog()</tt> and <tt>hideDialog()</tt>
 * display and dispose of the dialog window respectively.
 * <tt>setModal(boolean)</tt> and <tt>getModal()</tt> deal
 * with the modality of the dialog, and allow it to be
 * determined and changed if necessary.
 * <p>
 * <b>THREAD SAFETY:</b> Swing is NOT thread safe, and all operations
 * on the dialogs inheriting this interface must be done from the
 * <tt>EventDispatchThread</tt>
