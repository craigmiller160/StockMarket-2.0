/**
 * A basic interface for a simple API for making GUI classes that can
 * be updated abstractly in a Model-View-Presenter design pattern.
 * Its single method, <tt>changeProperty(PropertyChangeEvent)</tt>, allows any controller 
 * looking to update it to pass <tt>PropertyChangeEvent</tt>s to
 * the class via this interface using dependency inversion. The GUI 
 * class then handles the event without the controller
 * needing any knowledge of the view's implementation. The <tt>PropertyChangeEvent</tt>
 * passed to the method can be acted on or ignored, depending on the event's
 * attributes.
 * <p>
 * Property name values should be constants stored in a single class.
 * This ensures consistency and avoids errors.
 * <p>
 * <b>THREAD SAFETY:</b> Swing is NOT thread safe. All
 * methods in this class MUST be invoked on the <tt>EventDispatchThread</tt>.
