/**
 * An abstract implementation of the <tt>ListenerView</tt> and
 * <tt>PropertyChangeView</tt> interfaces. <tt>PropertyChangeView</tt>'s
 * sole method is inherited in abstract form and will need to be 
 * implemented by a subclass of this, but most of <tt>ListenerView</tt>'s
 * methods have an implementation here.
 * <p>
 * This class has been implemented to accept multiple external 
 * <tt>ActionListener</tt>s and store them in a list. This class
 * also implements <tt>actionPerformed(ActionEvent)</tt> inherited
 * from <tt>ActionListener</tt> as a final method. This implementation
 * simply creates a new <tt>ActionEvent</tt> with the same action command
 * as the one that was passed to it, but with this class as the event's
 * source. This allows for the external listening controller(s) to 
 * abstractly access this class, and the <tt>getValueForAction(String)</tt>
 * method specifically. (<b>NOTE:</b> If the event comes from an instance
 * of <tt>ListenerDialog</tt>, the source is not reassigned. This allows
 * events from the dialogs in this framework to convey their source to
 * the external listening controller(s), for the same reasons already
 * stated).
 * <p>
 * In addition to the <tt>changeProperty(PropertyChangeEvent)</tt> method 
 * inherited from <tt>PropertyChangeView</tt>, subclasses will need
 * to implement <tt>getValueForAction(String)</tt> from <tt>ListenerView</tt>
 * in order to extend this class. The documentation for these interfaces
 * should be consulted for the proper way to implement these methods.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> A view extending this class cannot also extend a GUI component class,
 * so views using this API will have to rely on composition (wrapping around
 * an instance of the GUI component their building) rather than inheritence
 * to create components.
 * <p>
 * <b>THREAD SAFETY:</b> Swing is NOT thread safe. All
 * methods in this class MUST be invoked on the <tt>EventDispatchThread</tt>.
