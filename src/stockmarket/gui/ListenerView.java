import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

/**
 * This interface provides a basic API to allow for a GUI class
 * to pass events to <tt>ActionListener</tt>s outside of the class.
 * This design is meant to facilitate loose coupling between view
 * and controller components of a program, allowing them to interact
 * through the <tt>ActionListener</tt> interface without needing
 * direct knowledge of each other.
 * <p>
 * In addition to providing methods to add and remove external
 * <tt>ActionListener</tt>s, this interface extends the <tt>ActionListener</tt>
 * interface itself. This allows implementing classes to simply assign
 * <tt>this</tt> as the listener for all actionable components, 
 * easily funneling all events to an external listener without the
 * components needing any knowledge of the listener's existence.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, the <tt>getValueForAction(String)</tt> method is provided as a tool
 * to allow the external listeners to perform the proper action. 
 * Many times, the action that needs to be done will require a value
 * inputed by the user. This method provides an abstract way to acquire
 * the necessary value(s) based on the <tt>actionCommand</tt> parameter
 * passed to the method. <b>NOTE:</b> This works best when action command
 * values are set as constants.
 * <p>
 * <b>THREAD SAFETY:</b> Swing is NOT thread safe. Since this interface
 * is intended to be used with Swing classes, its methods should
 * only be accessed on the <tt>EventDispatchThread</tt>.
