/**
 * Contains the models that store mutable data values for this program.<br>
 * 
 * IDEAS FOR MODELS:<br><br>
 * SelectedStockModel - contains a reference to a Stock object that is currently
 * selected, or null if there is no currently selected Stock.<br><br>
 * 
 * ComponentsEnabledModel - tracks which components in the GUI are currently enabled.
 * TODO Change the concept here slightly to be less about individual components, and
 * more about a particular state of the program.<br><br>
 * 
 * ChartModel - this is tied in some way to the models in JFreeChart that need to be
 * used for the model. Also, gotta have the timeframe in here some way.<br><br>
 * 
 * FindFieldModel - this controls the find field's state. Whether the button or the field
 * is visible.
 * 
 * NetModel - cash balance, net worth, gains/losses
 * 
 * TODO think about adding models for the buy/sell dialogs as well.
