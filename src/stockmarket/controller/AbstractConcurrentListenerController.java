/**
 * A concurrent enhancement of the <tt>AbstractListenerController</tt>.
 * This class is designed to handle the process of off-loading the
 * execution of events, updating of property models, and other 
 * processes from the <tt>EventDispatchThread</tt> to background 
 * threads. It also ensures that that all property changes are
 * returned to the view on the <tt>EventDispatchThread</tt>, thus
 * preserving the thread safety of the GUI.
 * <p>
 * This process is controlled by three methods:
 * <p>
 * <tt>actionPerformed(ActionEvent)</tt> is a method that is
 * invoked while still on the EDT. It checks the event to see
 * if the source is an instance of <tt>ListenerView</tt>, and
 * if so it invokes the <tt>getValueForAction(String)</tt>. This
 * invocation is safe because it occurs while still on the EDT.
 * This method then passes both the event and the value (if 
 * it was acquired) to a background thread for processing.
 * <p>
 * <tt>processEvent(ActionEvent,Object)</tt> parses the
 * event to determine the appropriate response. This method
 * is abstract and needs to be implemented to extend this
 * class. This method is virtually guaranteed to be accessed
 * by more than one thread at once, so proper synchronization
 * and thread safety is a must. Implementations of this method
 * generally update property models and perform various other
 * lengthy background tasks.
 * <p>
 * <tt>propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent)</tt> is invoked
 * while on the background thread when a bound property is 
 * changed in one of the models. It safely wraps the 
 * <tt>changeProperty(PropertyChangeEvent)</tt> methods from
 * the views in <tt>SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable) to
 * ensure that the event is only passed to the view on the 
 * EDT.
 * <p>
 * <b>THREAD SAFETY:</b> This class is thread safe. The only
 * possible compromise to its safety would come from the
 * GUI classes sending <tt>ActionEvent</tt>s to this class
 * not being properly contained to the EDT, but that would
 * be a problem outside of the control of this class.
