/**
 * Base controller API for building a program based on the Model-View-Controller
 * design pattern. It provides methods to abstractly handle as many models and views
 * as it needs to, storing them in synchronized lists until they are needed.
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:</b>
 * <p>
 * <b>1)</b> Controller classes should access and modify model properties through
 * the protected <tt>setModelProperty()</tt> and <tt>getModelProperty()</tt> methods,
 * which use reflection to invoke the corresponding methods in the model.
 * <p>
 * <b>THREAD SAFETY:</b> Thread safety is delegated to the synchronized list 
 * collection. The lists of models and views contained in this class are both
 * synchronized lists, so any add/remove/set operations will be thread-safe.
 * However, subclasses should be careful about implementing any iteration of
 * these lists, as that will require additional client-side locking. 
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> As of Version 2.0, the <tt>setModelProperty(String,Object)</tt> 
 * method will only work with model setter methods that accept a single parameter.
 * Multiple-parameter methods will fail at this time.
