/**
 * Expanded version of <tt>AbstractController</tt>. Like its superclass,
 * this class is capable of updating a range of models and views
 * registered with it, so long as they conform to this MVP framework.
 * Consult the documentation for this class's superclass for more
 * details.
 * <p>
 * The main new functionality of this class comes from the fact that
 * it implements the <tt>ActionListener</tt> interface. This allows
 * it to function as listener for events that occur in the views
 * that are added to it. The add/remove view methods of this class
 * have been overriden to check the views being added to see if
 * they are an instance of <tt>ListenerView</tt>. If they are, 
 * this class is added to it as a listener.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses will need to implement the <tt>actionPerformed(ActionEvent)</tt>
 * method, which will receive all events from the views so that any
 * model updates that are necessary can be performed. Classes implementing
 * <tt>ListenerView</tt> also have the <tt>getValueForAction(String)</tt>
 * method, which provides a great abstract tool for acquiring values
 * from the view that are needed to perform the required action.
 * Consult the documentation for <tt>ListenerView</tt> for more details.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, the listener structure of this MVP framework functions best
 * when the action commands of all <tt>ActionEvent</tt>s passed between
 * views and this controller are constants.
 * <p>
 * <b>THREAD SAFETY:</b> This class is thread safe because its super class
 * is thread safe. While this class adds methods, it doesn't add any state
 * variables, therefore the thread-safe design of its superclass applies
 * to this class as well.
